# proxy_chain_fetch
web scarping and cleaning the data from a table of proxy servers

#Concept:
when configuring my proxychain i find myself wasting a lot of time going through a list of sometimes dead servers, the reason for this program was to speed up that process by automationg the task of getting the top 6 proxies.

# Unresolved Issues
A rough bit of code and certainly not completed, issues with the socket connect_ext most of the time resulting in an infity loop and never returning the status.
I hope to solve the problem soon.
